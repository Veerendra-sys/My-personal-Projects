✅ 1. 🔍 Project Summary (Simple Explanation for Hiring)
“I built an AI-powered interactive map system using OpenCV and hand tracking, where users can point to countries with their fingers. When two countries are pointed at simultaneously, the system calculates and displays the flight time between them.”

Used MediaPipe for hand detection via cvzone.

Used perspective warping to align a flat map to the camera view.

Created interactive overlays to detect which country is being pointed at.

When two countries are pointed at, the system draws a line and displays the flight time between them.

✅ 2. 📜 Key Concepts Used in Code
Concept	Explanation
OpenCV	For image processing, camera capture, transformations.
cvzone	Simplifies hand tracking using MediaPipe and overlays text easily.
Hand Tracking	Detects the index fingertip of one or two hands in real-time.
Perspective Warping	Transforms a region of the camera feed into a flat, front-facing map using 4 corner points.
PointPolygonTest	Checks if a finger is inside a country's polygon.
Overlay Drawing	Colors the detected country and displays its name.
Warping Points/Polygons	Converts fingertip locations to warped coordinates that match the map.
Flight Time Matching	If two countries are selected, checks if a predefined flight time exists and displays it.

✅ 3. 🧠 Code Flow Explanation
python
Copy
Edit
# 1. Load map corner points and country polygons
map_points = pickle.load(...)      # 4 corners of the map
polygons = pickle.load(...)        # List of polygons for countries

# 2. Start webcam and set frame size
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(...)
cap.set(...)

# 3. Setup hand detector
detector = HandDetector(...)
🔁 Inside the Loop:
python
Copy
Edit
img = cap.read()  # Capture frame from camera

imgWarped, matrix = warp_image(img, map_points, size=[w, h])  # Perspective correction
warped_point = get_finger_location(img, imgWarped)  # Detect fingertip(s)

imgOverlay = np.zeros(...)  # Empty canvas

if warped_point:
    imgOverlay = create_overlay_image(polygons, warped_point, imgOverlay)  # Check if finger is in polygon
    imgOutput = inverse_warp_image(img, imgOverlay, map_points)  # Re-warp overlay back to camera frame

cv2.imshow("Output Image", imgOutput)
✅ 4. 📋 Sample Interview Questions & Answers
🔹 Q1. What is perspective warping in this project?
A: Perspective warping is used to align the tilted or angled map in the camera view to a front-facing flat version. We use 4 manually defined corner points and cv2.getPerspectiveTransform() to compute the warp matrix.

🔹 Q2. How does hand tracking work in your code?
A: I used cvzone.HandTrackingModule which wraps MediaPipe's hand detection. It returns landmark positions of fingers. I use the index fingertip (landmark 8) to detect where the user is pointing on the map.

🔹 Q3. How do you detect which country the user is pointing at?
A: Each country is represented as a polygon of points. Using OpenCV's cv2.pointPolygonTest(), I check if the warped fingertip is inside any polygon. If yes, I highlight that polygon.

🔹 Q4. What happens when two countries are pointed at?
A: If both hands are detected, I get the fingertip positions from both hands, check which country each one touches, and then look up a predefined flight time list. If a match is found, I display the route and time between them.

🔹 Q5. What is the role of the overlay image?
A: It’s a blank image on which I draw detected countries, lines, and flight info. This image is then re-warped back to the original perspective using inverse warping and blended with the camera frame.

🔹 Q6. Why do we warp points and polygons?
A: Because the map in the camera view is at an angle, the fingertip positions need to be transformed to match the flat map’s coordinates. That’s why we warp them using the same perspective transform matrix.

🔹 Q7. What challenges did you face in this project?
A:

Calibrating the four map corner points accurately.

Ensuring warp/unwarp lo'gic worked with both points and polygons.

Managing hand detection when only one or both hands are visible.

Preventing false positives on country detection.
