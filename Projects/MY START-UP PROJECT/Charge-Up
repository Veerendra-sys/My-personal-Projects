We all have felt the need for more electric vehicles instead of the one that runs on fossil fuels.
When we did a market survey we found the lack of charging stations to be a big factor in the
lower number of electric vehicles. But even though charging stations are available, EV owners
are not properly aware of them and there is always a lingering doubt if the charging station will
be free and available when they want.
Hence we came up with this business solution that aims to curb this issue by providing a one
stop solution to all bookings related to charging stations for EVs, which ultimately increases a
prospective EV ownerâ€™s confidence.
